### About Me

I am an AI engineer and research scientist with a strong interest in science-driven technology. My work focuses on applying machine learning to large-scale scientific inverse problems, spanning geophysics, inverse theory, uncertainty quantification, and high-performance computing. I have developed and trained large-scale diffusion models designed to serve as priors for inverse problem workflows.
More recently, I have been building agentic AI workflows for industrial automation, global trade management, and energy exploration, along with designing end-to-end training pipelines for large language models tailored to these applications.
